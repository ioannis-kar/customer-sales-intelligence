Customer & Sales Intelligence
Business Intelligence Case Study (Tableau)

Overview
This project is a Business Intelligence case study focused on understanding how revenue is generated, who the key customers are and how performance changes over time.

Business Context
The company operates through multiple sales channels:
- Online
- Physical Store
- Partner

While transactional sales data is available, decision-makers do not have a clear, consolidated view of:
- which customer segments drive revenue
- how channels perform relative to each other
- how revenue evolves month by month

Business Questions
The analysis was guided by a small set of questions:
- How much total revenue does the business generate?
- Which customer segments contribute most to revenue?
- How does revenue differ across sales channels?
- How does revenue change over time?
- Do customer segments behave differently across channels?

Key Insights
From the analysis, several observations stand out:

- Consumer customers are the primary revenue drivers across all sales channels.
- Physical Stores generate the highest total revenue, followed by Online and Partner channels.
- Online revenue is largely driven by Consumer customers.
- Corporate customers contribute consistently, but at a secondary level.
- VIP customers represent a relatively small share of total revenue.
- Revenue varies noticeably from month to month, highlighting the importance of ongoing trend monitoring.


Recommendations
Based on the findings, the following next steps are suggested:

- Further analyze Consumer customer behavior to better understand and support the main revenue driver.
- Monitor customer segment performance at the channel level to identify opportunities for more targeted strategies.
- Track revenue trends on a monthly basis to quickly identify changes in performance.
- Review the role of the Partner channel to assess whether it supports strategic objectives beyond direct revenue.

Tools Used
- Tableau Desktop for data modeling and dashboard development.
- SQLite for data validation and exploratory analysis.
